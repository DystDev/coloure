# Coloure
Coloure is a easy, free and quick way to generate intelligent and stylish colour pallets for a usage of your choice. Firstly, choose the number of colours you need and click the refresh button! Do this as many times as you need until a pallet of your choice appears - then, you can save the hex codes and names of each colour for later!
